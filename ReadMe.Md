This repository contains information that might be useful for you as a new and or prospective student wanting to work with me.

If you want to come and work with me, and after instructed to do so, you are expected to read this material. If you are working with me, I expect you know all the stuff that is in it.

This is intended to provide guidance and structure to our interaction, hoping to make it clear what we should each expect from each other. That ensures that we can enroll in a trully sinergistic relation where we effectively and efficiency learn from each other.

I do not tolerate racism or any kind of discrimination based on whatever personal views you or others might have. If you are a racist please do not work with me.

# Suggested readings

I recommend the reading of "The Art of Being a Scientist"", by Roel Snieder and Ken Larner. I have a copy you can borrow. Just ask me for it!

# Suggested tools

I would recommend your thesis to be written in Latex. If you do not know what Latex is, maybe visit Overleaf at https://www.overleaf.com/ where you can compile Latex documents, including hundreds of templates for thesis, reports, CVs, etc without the need to install any software.

I expect you to be working from the start using R and doing reproducible research via dynamic reports in either RMarqdown or Quarto.

if you need a refreshing on R you can try this tutorial

and if you need an RMarkdown template this might be a useful start

If you do not have a reference manager, I highly recommend JABREF available at https://www.jabref.org/, as it is free and deals with bibtex natively, and does much of what one might want to do managing references.

If you want integration between JABREF and Overleaf you can take a look at 


# When you want feedback on code

If you want me to provide feedback on code I xpect to receive a script that runs up to the point where it does not, if that is the case. Ideally I would receive a request to access a sahred folder where the code (and eventually all the required data / scripts) necessary to run the code at this end
